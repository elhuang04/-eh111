                        <h3 id="1.1">1.1 Inspiration</h3>
                        <p>
                            About a year ago, I came across a video made by the YouTube channel, Answer in Progress, titled ‚Äúhow i fixed my attention span.‚Äù Throughout the video, the creator talks about different ways they tracked their productivity by mapping their brain activity to each of their everyday actions. This way, the creator was able to easily identiy patterns in which tasks in a day made her more productive or less productive. The video concludes with her data visualizations and conclusions about her habits and an impressive finding about how mediation hugely improved her productivity. I wanted to be able to identify whether there might be a similar ‚Äúproductivity trigger‚Äù with my daily routines by looking specifically at how specific music choices might influence my productivity. 
                        </p>
                            <iframe class="thumb" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vYaNiC4kchg?si=_uboiV_5ulYIY4GN" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                        <h3 id="1.2">1.2 Hypothesis</h3>
                        The basis of my data collection hinges on the inference that music may be a potential ‚Äúproductivity trigger.‚Äù In other words, listening to music of a particular genre might make me more productive than not listening to music. My reasoning for this assumption is due to my constant reach for music in everyday tasks including homework, chores, walking, and more. Although I listen to music everyday, there are often times where music does not help my focus. Thus, I hypothesize that I might actually be the most productive when I am not listening to music, and secondarily productive when listening to music without words, which limits the distraction factor of music listening. 
                        <h3 id="1.3">1.3 Objective</h3>
                        <p>
                            Vallor describes the key objective of self-examination towards the lifelong improvement of the soul (joy of increasingly virtuous living). By Vallor‚Äôs definition, practicing self-examination means measuring one‚Äôs (past and current) actions and dispositions against the moral norms and virtues, ore more generally recognizing one‚Äôs own flaws, then taking action towards acting rightly. As she describes further, a key component of reflective self-examination is to ‚Äúidentify those vices to which I have in the past tended to succumb, and hence aid me in devising more effective strategies for self-improvement.‚Äù
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This definition leads Vallor to pose the following question of reflective self-examination in a technomoral contex: ‚ÄúMight [reflective self-examination] gradually refine our moral judgment of the best courses of technosocial action, and allow us to experience greater joy in living with the technologies we create?‚Äù To best make refinements and improvements on our moral judgement and actions, it becomes necessary to understand our habits more completely through a more thorough observation of our technosocial behaviors/ activities. Tracking digital tech use and self-reflections throughout this project ensures a more critical evaluation of how technology influences our daily beahviors, a habit that might give insight on improving personal technosocial habits. 
                        </p>
                        <h3 id="1.4">1.4 Research Design & Methodology</h3>
                        <p>
                            My process methodology for Project 2 comprised of data collection in 3 different methods. One component of my data collection process was labeling with categorization the intent behind web usage for each activity marked in my browser history (collected via a Google Chrome extension rather than a browser). Since this is an aspect of metadata that could not be collected in any other way, but was important for framing/ understanding my productivity on any given day, it was necessary to understand the data more comprehensively. Secondly, I used custom automations and pre-processing to control the songs that could be used throughout the project. Since I typically listen to the same couple of songs on loop, before my data collection began, I curated 3 playlists: each playlist to represent a broad genre of my 20 most listened songs in Pop, Instrumental (Rock, Orchestral, EDM), and R&B. On my phone, I created custom automations to run and track everytime I started and stopped listening to a particular playlist/ genre. While this step may have been similarly accomplished in the post-collection process, collecting them through custom trackers allowed for more control of the data that was relevant for this project‚Äôs insights and eliminated a lot of pre-processing steps that could be more difficult to assess post-collection. Lastly, I used a daily survey with both a quantitative and qualitative component to self-assess my productivity for the day on a scale from 1-10 while reflecting on the day in a written entry. Using digital tools to collect data rather than recording both manual and automatic traces by hand ensured my data to be as accurate as possible during my collection period (9/25 - 10/2). 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            By collecting data through these various methods and sources, the context for each piece of data can be better understood both qualitatively and quantitatively. Overall, to most accurately represent behaviors in the status quo, I used as many automated trackers as possible to reduce outside influence of surveillance on behavior to observe my relationship with music and productivity as accurately as possible (insights that would reflect my everyday behavior/ lifestyle). As D'Ignazio and Klein in <em>Data Feminism</em> describe, ‚Äúconsidering context, a process that includes understanding the provenance and environment from which the data was collected, as well as working hard to frame context in data communication (i.e., the numbers should not speak for themselves in charts any more than they should in spreadsheets).‚Äù As each data collection source is accompanied with several other pieces of metadata including manual observations and custom traces, the provenance of each piece of data can be understood more wholly.   
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Additionally, Heather Krause, a data scientist cited in D'Ignazio and Klein‚Äôs <em>Data Feminism</em> provides a basic 5 question framework for data context definition: ‚ÄúWhere did it come from? Who collected it? When? How was it collected? Why was it collected?‚Äù In this case, the data is coming from both automatic collection sources (Google Takeout/ YouTube Music, BroTime/ Browser History), and manual collection sources (Google Form for Productivity Questionnaire, and manual entry into Google Sheets). Some of the data could be cross-referenced by another source, which verified the accuracy of the data collection. Each data record was collected when a specific activity triggered a timestamp, and most typically through already written code made by Google, Microsoft, etc. Even the manual portions of the data collection were recorded through timestamps in digital formats (Google Sheets, Google Forms). Thus, all data collection was relatively consistent in format and process (same tracking/ recording algorithms). Lastly, as provided previously, the purpose of the data collection was for this project and my own personal observation/ reflection.

                          <p>Today was decently productive! I started my day with an 8am meeting, then had class until 2pm. After class I went to my work shift at the help desk until 3:40pm then went to the career fair, talked to recruiters, applied to open internships until 5:30pm. I finished dinner at 5:45 pm and started working on some student org deliverables until 6:20 pm. At 6:20 I started preparing for a client call with my co-founder and finished the meeting at 7pm. At 7pm, I took a nap and didn't wake up until 9pm. Then at 9pm I started working on some student org things again and also took a look at planning for some future events. At 10pm I started working on this assignment and planning my work for the rest of the week. Overall, a pretty productive day, although I'm wondering if I'm not doing enough orgs/ spending enough time on extracurriculars that might move me forward since I seem to have a pretty decent amount of free time in the day.</p>

                          <p>
                            Overall, today was not the most productive. I woke up at 8am for my morning shift at the helpdesk and wrapped up my shift around 10:30am. After my shift, I went to some of the dining halls looking for something to eat, but realized that it was a bit too late. By the time I had gotten around to Lulu, it was already around 11:15am. I went back to my dorm room and tried to boil some water in my new pan, however, realized that I might need a different pan for this stove (incompatible types...). Near 11:45am, I realized I needed to prepare for a meeting. My meeting finished up at around 1pm and then I went on to lunch. At lunch time, I was super unproductive, I basically spent the entire hour just eating and watching the show Friends. When I got back to my dorm, I took a nap and didn't wake up until closer to 3pm in the afternoon. Once I woke up, I started going through some of my student org deliverables, my CS 299 classwork project up until 4:30pm. I then had a meeting with Casey on some student org planning and collaboration ideas and wrapped up the meeting at 5pm. At 5:20pm, I reached my friend Vivien's dorm and we walked together around the lake and ate dinner together. Once we finished, it was around 6:30pm and I got back to my dorm around 6:45. I'm not super clear what I did at that time, but I believe I may have taken another nap and wasted more time on my phone. Since around 10pm, I've been looking through my photos trying to recover an old/ corrupted one I wanted to use and also finishing up a load of laundry. While I wasn't able to get a lot done today, I'm hoping that the energy from the naps will allow me to get more work done in the next few hours before heading off to sleep.

                          <p>
                            Overall, not too bad of a day! Started my day around 7:30-8am and worked on tracking student org budgeting/ finances. At 8:30 had a meeting and kept working on my independent study deliverables until 9:50am. Had class from 9:55 to 11:10am. Directly after class I had work at the helpdesk until 2:15pm. After class, I went back to my dorm to pick some org materials and debug some of the instrumentation for this project. At 2:40 I picked up copies of fliers for my org event. Around 3pm, I posted some fliers up around Lulu and Sci. At around 3:30pm, I went to office hours for CS 235 to ask some questions on today‚Äôs lecture and the upcoming exam. I left around 4pm and started working on some homework for other classes. At 5pm, I sent a couple of student org emails and met up with Vivien at Sci to go to the emporium to buy snacks for the upcoming org event. At around 5:10, we started setting up A/V for the org event and hosted our org meeting from 5:30-6:15pm. We then lined up with some new members to eat dumplings at Lulu! It was a long line but it moved pretty quickly and I was able finish my meal before 7pm. At 7pm, I had a meeting with a student about GDSC and event networking/ hosting with GDGs and GDEs. We finished our meeting around 7:20pm and I went to my dorm immediately after. I wrapped up some laundry try and cleaned up my room until around 7:40pm and took a nap until around 8:10pm. At 8:10pm, I had a client/ market research call and finished the call at 9pm. Once the meeting had concluded, I doomscrolled on Instagram since I was unable to call my parents (currently in a different time zone!) and was unproductive until around 9:40pm. I then finished my laundry/ folded and fitted sheets until 10pm. From 10-11 I took a shower/ boiled water/ swept floor/ took a quick walk and then settled back into some student org work until 11:30pm. Then at 11:30 the automation I made for my phone (for this project, pulled this form up) - now it is 11:46. Overall, my day was pretty productively spent and there are not too many areas that need me to reduce distractions in.

                            Somewhat of an unproductive day. Relatively, today was more productive than Wednesday, but significantly less productive than yesterday. I didn't get a lot of items off my to-do list today and spent the majority of the day working on some student org deliverables and going to clases.

                          <p>
                            Super unproductive!! I sepnt the entire morning working on my CS 250 project with Vivien and barely wrapped up the minimal personal deliverables. After grabbing lunch, I spent the majority of the afternoon watching Friends on HBO max then taking a nap, then talking a long walk before finally settling back into my emails and work. Because of the unproductivity today, I have a TON of work to catch up on between today and tomorrow to ensure all of my work is completed on time in addition to anything extra I want to accomplish this week. I wish I had been more aware of the time today and ketp to my initial schedule of deliverables to be completed by the end of today.

                            Completed majority of agenda items for today, overall pretty productive. Even with a lot of distractions, stayed on track to complete high priority homework assignments. Took lots of naps and entertainment breaks throughout the day but also spent many hours on homework and assignments. Completed 3 problem set assignments out of 4, 4th still in progress to be completed by tonight. Could have taken less breaks today to be more efficient, but overall met expectations.

                            Stayed on track to finish all homework for the entire day. Spent the whole day completing Physics P-Set leftover homework from weekend; classes in between all time spent on homework from 9:55am until 10pm (10:40 bus arrival back at Wellesley). Skipped morning shift and class to finish up leftover p-sets and class assignments, went to MIT from 11:30am bus and came back at 10:40pm then slept.

                            Not super productive, spent the day on a lot of e-board and recruiting tasks rather than high priority homework and classwork items. Wish I had spent less time on my phone and taken more time to study for upcoming exams. Recorded an SOI for an e-board application for over 2 hours before submitting. Majority of the day spent going to class and completing some small homework assignments during work hours. Went to bed early and finished laundry.

                            Not the best/ most productive day, but not the worst either. After my classes today, I finally had a check-in for my independent study, then spent the 1-2 hours after taking customer/ usability calls. After the 2 hour block of meetings, Vivien and I debriefed and summarized our key takeaways for about another hour. Then, I got dinner and spent a little too long eating it. Howeover, today was overall a good catch-up day for learning progress for all my classes in the semester. After I got back to my dorm, I spent majority of the evening studying for my CS 235 exam. Wish I had been more productive on previous days of this week because it would have given me more time to go over some of the concepts I glossed over/ didn't fully understand in the problem sets more thoroughly. Went to sleep pretty early (riight after this survey) since I already feel tired from studying. Hopefully, I can continue my review in the topics I wasn't able to get to yet tomorrow morning before the exam.

Part 3: Show your digital data traces visualizations (ideally you want to choose platforms for which you have written in Part 1 & Part 2). For example, if you measured how productive you were when listening to music, you can download your Spotify data traces to find out what kind of music you listened to during that session. Explain what you see.
<!-- <h3 id="3.3">3.3 Web Browser Activity during Music Listening Sessions</h3>
Research Design: Do the questions you asked meaningfully capture your relationship with (digital) technology (i.e. focus on important aspects of it that often concern you)? Did you collect data consistently and accurately? Did you provide evidence of your process?
Data Analysis and Visualization: Did you draw meaningful conclusions from your data? Did you generate insightful visualizations (manual or digital) that indicate your tech use as part of your daily life? 
Web Page Report: Did you follow the five-part structure for the report; did you write cohesively providing evidence as appropriate, making strong arguments; does your web page look good?
Above and beyond - Did you take the project to heart and did an impressive job in all the above-listed areas, going beyond what was required in this document with respect to one or more of these areas (e.g. number of questions you asked, amount of data you collected, how you represented your work, visualizations you created, etc. etc.). -->

            <h2 id="4.0">4. Conclusion</h2>
            My process methodology for Project 2 comprised of data collection in 3 different methods.

            One component of my data collection process was labeling with categorization the intent behind web usage for each activity marked in my browser history (collected via a Google Chrome extension rather than a browser). Since this is an aspect of metadata that could not be collected in any other way, but was important for framing/ understanding my productivity on any given day, it was necessary to understand the data more comprehensively. 
            
            Secondly, I used custom automations and pre-processing to control the songs that could be used throughout the project. Since I typically listen to the same couple of songs on loop, before my data collection began, I curated 3 playlists: each playlist to represent a broad genre of my 20 most listened songs in Pop, Instrumental (Rock, Orchestral, EDM), and R&B. On my phone, I created custom automations to run and track everytime I started and stopped listening to a particular playlist/ genre. While this step may have been similarly accomplished in the post-collection process, collecting them through custom trackers allowed for more control of the data that was relevant for this project‚Äôs insights and eliminated a lot of pre-processing steps that could be more difficult to assess post-collection. 
            
            Lastly, I used a daily survey with both a quantitative and qualitative component to self-assess my productivity for the day on a scale from 1-10 while reflecting on the day in a written entry. By collecting data through these various methods and sources, the context for each piece of data can be better understood both qualitatively and quantitatively. 
            
            Overall, to most accurately represent behaviors in the status quo, I used as many automated trackers as possible to reduce outside influence of surveillance on behavior to observe my relationship with music and productivity as accurately as possible (insights that would reflect my everyday behavior/ lifestyle). Besides the project‚Äôs objective to collect and represent data in a meaningful way, my personal motivation for the project was wanting to know/ observe any links between music listening choices/ when I was listening to music and when I was the most productive. Parallel to the idea of considering context in Data Feminism, collecting these data points also serves a purpose to provide more context and understanding to behavioral trends in my everyday life that might otherwise have been difficult to observe without synthesizing my personal data into meaningful, clear representations of data communication.
