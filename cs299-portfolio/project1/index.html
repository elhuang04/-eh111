                    <h2 id="1.0">1. Introduction</h2>
                    In everyday interactions, using technology has become inseparable from one‚Äôs daily tasks. In Shannon Vallor‚Äôs <em>Technology and the Virtues: A Philosophical Guide to a Future Worth Wanting,</em> Vallor draws from traditional virtue ethics frameworks, asserting that the good life remains achievable if we each actively shape our character. As emerging technology continues to develop in unpredictable ways, Vallor urges the need to build foundations beyond individual flourishing for society‚Äôs collective wellbeing and understand how to integrate new technologies into our lives by using them wisely.  To demonstrate the essence of Vallor‚Äôs virtue ethics and how they transfer into our technomoral decisions, the following sections exemplify applications of each trait in animated films.
                    <h2 id="2.0">2. Honesty</h2>
                    <h3 id="2.1">2.1 Description</h3>
                    Universally, honesty is a fundamental moral ideal necessary to flourish with others. To express this definition more clearly, Vallor (2018) defines honesty to be ‚Äúan exemplary respect for truth, along with the practical expertise to express that respect appropriately in technosocial contexts‚Äù (p. 122). The moral ideal of honesty, Vallor distinguishes, is to establish integrity in the appropriate conduct, rather than a complete truth used for vicious intent. In a technomoral context, Vallor extends technomoral honesty to have the most significance in our relation with information, communication, and privacy.

                    <h3 id="2.2">2.2 Example of Virtue</h3>
                        <img src="https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/images/open-uri20150608-27674-emufu7_cb6dc499.jpeg?region=0%2C0%2C1580%2C880">
                        <p>
                            Actions of honesty are often more representative of one‚Äôs virtue than words. A character that exemplifies Vallor‚Äôs honesty is Ralph from <em>Wreck-It Ralph</em>. The film outlines Ralph‚Äôs villain-to-hero transformation through a series of self-reflection experiences. Ralph begins the film questioning the significance of his role, yearning for a more purposeful life through an acknowledgement of his work. Initially tactful, Ralph does not directly confront any of his co-workers, other characters in the same game, about his long-standing dissatisfaction with his treatment, knowing that speaking directly about it might further tension and worsen the relationships he has with others. However, after being socially instigated, Ralph expresses all his grievances about constantly being put in a ‚Äúbad guy‚Äù role with no respect or recognition for his work, in addition to his exclusion from the group even after work hours. Ralph‚Äôs main objective for the movie becomes seeking to win a medal to prove his capability to be a hero (‚Äúgood guy‚Äù), a proof of validation he belongs in the community with everyone else. By the end of the movie, Ralph realizes that bottling all his emotions doesn‚Äôt strengthen the connection he has with others; he finally shares a heartfelt sentiment with one of his coworkers about a mutual understanding through their shared experiences of feeling excluded. The movie concludes with Ralph stating, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need a medal to tell me I‚Äôm a good guy‚Äù (Moore, 2012). Ralph embodies honesty as he learns to be vulnerable and share his feelings more honestly, an action that deepens the relationships he shares with others. A key takeaway from the film is the importance of expressing honesty appropriately: sharing our truths without causing harm; knowing when to speak up and when to listen.

                    <h3 id="2.3">2.3 Connection With Technology</h3>
                        <p>
                            Ralph‚Äôs character embodies honesty in two critical technomoral contexts: 1) an internal honesty or self-honesty, and 2) an external honesty towards others. As the film revolves around a plot of internal conflict, much of the movie shares Ralph‚Äôs journey to accepting his role in the game world, the purpose of his actions, and how his actions affect those around him. Rich Moore, the director of the film, clarifies, ‚ÄúThey're just gonna accept who they are, and that would be the message in the film, it's okay to be who you are‚Äù (MacQuarrie, 2012). In a technomoral context, this means being honest about your role and contributions to the technological world. For instance, an awareness of the data we create and use, and the information we choose to provide for a more convenient service. Secondly, Ralph demonstrates the difficulty of finding balance with external honesty through his attempts in connecting with others in his community. In the lens of technology, Ralph‚Äôs reluctance to share certain personal information mirrors our rationalization to share or protect our data privacy. Thus, honesty becomes an essential virtue that extends into our technological existence, enabling us to flourish in our own lives and with others.

                    <h2 id="3.0">3. Self-Control</h2>
                    <h3 id="3.1">3.1 Description</h3>
                        With increasing technological innovations pulling us with distractions in every direction, new innovations such as screen time and minimal/ dumb phones suggest a need for limiting our interaction with technology. To define, Vallor describes self-control in the traditional sense as a ‚Äúwillful restraint of wrong desire,‚Äù (p.123) and a ‚Äúdeliberate cultivation of right desire‚Äù (p.123). To capture the importance of self-control in a technomoral context, Vallor demonstrates increasing desire and consumption of virtual goods across frequently used applications and games. In more detail, Vallor presents technomoral self-control as the ability to consciously and carefully consider authentic desires that contribute to the holistic one‚Äôs well-being (pp.123-125). 
                    <h3 id="3.2">3.2 Example of Virtue</h3>
                        <img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/disney/images/c/c1/Microbots_2.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150216185801">
                        <p>
                            Based on real-world examples in innovation, the film <em>Big Hero 6</em> is a coming-of-age film exploring concepts of self-control (in a technomoral context) with new technological developments. The protagonist of the film, Hiro, is a teenage robotics prodigy who loves to compete in illegal robot fights. With the help of his brother and his peers, Hiro learns the importance of responsible design and engineering as the film progresses. The self-control that Hiro cultivates through the film is directly juxtaposed with that of the antagonist, Professor Robert Callaghan, who uses technology to fulfill his own desires, harming those around him in the process. At the beginning of the film, a new innovation is introduced: Hiro creates microbots that are capable of linking together via commands from a neural transmitter. Hiro showcases this project at a university‚Äôs admissions event, boasting its limitless potential to make progress in areas of construction, transportation, manual labor, and more. Much later in the film, we discover that the microbots have been stolen by Professor Callaghan to seek revenge on a former colleague. Blinded by grief and rage, Callaghan activates dangerous and unstable technology with the goal of demolishing his former colleague‚Äôs headquarters. In contrast, Hiro‚Äôs self-control is continuously cultivated throughout the film with the support of his brother‚Äôs intention: Baymax, a personal healthcare companion robot designed only for the protection and safety of its users, which prevents Hiro from making impulsive or harmful decisions (Hall, Williams, 2014).

                        <p>
                            In both film and real-life, Baymax is intentionally designed to facilitate flourishing with others. The research project that led to Baymax began at Carnegie Mellon, led by Professor Chris Atkeson, with Atkeson‚Äôs research on soft robotics. Atkeson‚Äôs design for a robotic arm leveraged soft materials including fabrics, light balloons, and light plastics to extend greater safety when operating near or on people (CMU, 2014). In this core design decision (in both the character and the research), several aspects of self-control are embedded into the technology. First, Atkeson‚Äôs expertise in robotics provides him with the tools to assess how his creations might be dangerous to others. His research considers alternatives to conventionally metal robots in order to create robots that both move scientific research forward and contribute to the wellbeing of others.

                    <h2 id="4.0">4. Humility</h2>
                    <h3 id="4.1">4.1 Description</h3>
                    <p>
                        In traditional cultural contexts, Vallor describes humility as an essential self-assessment of one‚Äôs character, crucial for personal growth and self-improvement (pp.125-126). When we apply this concept to the technological realm, humility takes on a broader meaning. It becomes an acknowledgment of our current knowledge and expertise, as well as an awareness of our limitations. Vallor distinguishes that new innovations are a fallacy for mastery, lending a blindness to the unresolved gaps of current technological solutions. With new tools being constantly developed, maintaining rationality by weighing the risks and rewards is essential for embracing technological change. Humility becomes a critical intermediate in our process of assessing new technologies: to understand its benefits and consequences more thoroughly before accepting them into our lives.

                    <h3 id="4.2">4.2 Example of Virtue</h3>

                        Merida, the protagonist in Disney Pixar‚Äôs 2012 animated film <em>Brave</em> exhibits humility as she learns to lead her kingdom. Merida, a headstrong, defiant, and rebellious teenager begins the film with a challenge: needing to take on royal responsibilities as a princess of her kingdom. Wanting to set her own rules for life, Merida refuses to perform her duties crucial to forming alliances with neighboring clans. Merida‚Äôs mother strongly disapproves of Merida‚Äôs actions and warns her of the threat of diplomatic harm on her people. As a result, their already strained relationship continues to worsen causing Merida to curse her mother with an unknown effect. The curse transforms her mother into a bear, requiring Merida to quickly find a solution to turn her mother back into a human. Over the course of the film, Merida and her mother (in bear form) get closer together in the process of trying to survive in nature while Merida finds a way to undo the curse. Navigating the forest together, Merida observes Elinor‚Äôs wisdom, grace, and selflessness. She realizes that strength isn‚Äôt solely based on mastery over archery skills or physical prowess; it‚Äôs also about understanding, compassion, and vulnerability. Merida cultivates humility when realizing her mistakes and following through by taking responsibility for the consequences of her actions. Throughout the course of their days spent in nature, Merida grows an appreciation for the effort her mother takes to support both the family and the kingdom. With a renewed mother-daughter relationship, Merida breaks the curse with the love she has gained for her mother (Andrews, Chapman, 2012).

In essence, Merida displays humility in her admission of her mistakes and acknowledging the areas she can learn from her mother in.

                        Throughout <em>Brave</em>, hunting and the use of bow and arrows to defend the kingdom as a security measure are ubiquitous. Given that the movie takes place in the 10th century, there are many new technological advancements that have taken the place of those same tools. Currently, many royal families including Prince Harry and Meghan Markle and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex spend roughly $2-3 million annually to keep their families safe (Chmielewski, 2021). Thus, one could imagine, if the movie were to take place in a 21st century setting, that the kingdom might integrate smart home security systems to better protect families. These modern systems provide reassurance through features like efficient emergency response handling, comprehensive protection against environmental threats, and remote monitoring accessible from any mobile device. While these smart systems offer many affordances to safety and security, they are not without limitation. While they enhance safety, constant video monitoring poses privacy risks; sensitive information or contents may become prone to exposure and be captured inadvertently. Moreover, detection algorithms are still evolving, striving to improve accuracy in identifying video content. So, even in this high-tech kingdom, balancing security and privacy remains an ongoing challenge.

                    <h2>Justice</h2>
                    Description
                    While justice varies in definition in traditional contexts, the following concepts are universally central to the role of justice in ethics: deserved action and humane benevolence (pp.127-128). By extension, we can converge our understanding of technomoral considerations to ideas of rightness, fairness, and responsibility. Vallor formalizes this definition with two key components: 1) a just, fair, and deserved access to technology, and 2) a concern for the impacts of technology on others. It follows that the first step to achieving greater technomoral justice begins with designing and developing technology more fairly and responsibly.

                    <h2>Courage</h2>
                    Description
                        Courage, in the classical sense, is consistent fear of wrongess outweighing the the fear of taking risks to act rightly (p.129). In more detail, to act rightly means to maintain the fortitude for goodness of considerable moral weight. With cases that are comfortable, where the threat to our dignity is not present, there is a demonstration of a lack of moral courage. Now, in a technosicial life, each new piece of technology presents new risks in our choices. Technomoral courage, as Vallor describes is a ‚Äúreliable disposition toward intelligent feat and hope with respect to the moral and material dangers and opportunities presented by emerging technologies‚Äù (p. 131). While traditional moral courage may allows us to assume a continuation of the status quo, addressing technomoral issues requires confronting the implications of each choice.

                    <h2>Empathy</h2>
                    Description
                        Distinctly, Vallor describes empathy as form of ‚Äúco-feeling‚Äù or compassion shared with another person rather than the support or concern felt for another person (pp. 132-133). Empathy, as a moral virtue, is a complete understanding of another to be moved by both joys and pains, the ability to learn or cultivate dispositions that expand our capacity to feel for another (134-137). As defined in a technomoral context, Vallor states empathy as the ‚Äúcultivated opennes to being morally moved to caring action by the emotions of other members of our technosocial world‚Äù (p. 133). Dependent on others, extracting the right degree of empathy for certain situations or contexts is increasingly challenging without a collective cultivation of empathy in others.

                    <h2>Care</h2>
                    Description
                    Simply defined, care is meeting the needs of others. Effective care for someone requires a reliable or routinely labor rather than an immediate or ephemeral compassion. Further, moral development is dependent on one‚Äôs active response to the needs of others. Lending this definition in the scope of technology, Vallor describes care to mean ‚Äúa skillful, attentive, responsible, and emotionally responsive disposition to personally meet the needs of those with whom we share our technosocial environment‚Äù (p.139).  Consequently, relying on technological shortcuts for human care may come at a moral cost. Without genuine human interactions where we experience mutual dependence, vulnerability, and gratitude, we are unable to fully cultivate our moral selves.

                    <h2>Civility</h2>
                    Description
                    At the beginning of the chapter, Vallor provides a local definition of civility: a sincere approach to live well with others, to collectively converse about policy, to ‚Äúdefend our distinc concepts of the good life‚Äù, and to work towards shared goods of technosocial life (p.141). Uniquely, the scope of civility as a virtue expands beyond the private, individual morality and broadens to a public and political moral character. Thereforce, to cultivate the chaacter of technomoral civlity is to flourish together as a globally networked society.

                    <h2>Flexibility</h2>
                    Description
                    Contrary to the idea of flexible moral nature (lacking in virtue), flexibility in a virtuous context is to modulate action, belief, and feeling under new conditions (p.145). The difference between flexible moral character and flexibility as a virtue is the tolerance of new situations without compromise of character. Accordingly, technomoral flexibility in a collective, global practice embeds an additional requirement: a disposition to refrain from beliefs that do not cultivate practical wisdom. In other words, a global technomoral flexibility demands downselecting criteria for flexibility that hinge on the interests of global civility and flourishing.

                    Example of Virtue
                    Elemental
                    Elemental is a film about adapting yourself to fit new environments. Throughout the film, the protagonist Ember, comes from a family with long-standing traditions. Their environment, Element City, is a place where fire, water, land, and air residents live side by side. Ember deeply appreciates her parents‚Äô sacrifices who left their homeland to provide her with a better life. Thus, she truly looks up to her family and is reluctant to change her ways to adapt to new technological changes that are making her parents‚Äô lives difficult. Ember meets Wade, someone who always goes-with-the-flow, and their personalities are a perfect complement to one another. Through their interactions, differences in their attitudes and personalities spark Ember to reevaluate her approach to life. As their relationship strengthens into something more meaningful, Wade‚Äôs adaptability rubs off on Ember and she begins to consider a future beyond the traditions she once saw and embrace how her unique skillsets and talents could embrace change.

                    <h2>Perspective</h2>
                    Description
                    Stated simply, perspective is the attention and understanding to parts of a moral whole (p.149). Beyond the technosocial definition, perspective is an understanding of self in place of a larger context. To cultivate and exercise perspective, one needs to relate individual needs and desires to those of others. Moreover, in a technomoral context, cultivating perspective needs an underlying understanding of the habits that are conducive to self-cultivation, technosocial conditions are essential to flourishing together, and a bigger picture view of the good life.

                    <h2>Magnanimity</h2>
                    Description
                    In the classical moral context, Vallor defines magnanimity to be an entitled sense of political and personal superiority. In more detail Vallor descries the magnimous person as someone who is not concerned with ego-involved contests and instead places value on intangible goods and actions that helps themselves flourish (p.152). By extension, moral leaders possess magnimity in their leadership, providing ‚Äúcourage, deep wisdom, expansive empathy, extraordinary care, and tolerance for great frustration and conflict‚Äî because they have successfully cultivated these virtues as resources for such projects‚Äù (p. 153). In a technomoral context, magnimity presents itself through global leaders of technology that facilitate the global community to flourish. However, Vallor states her observation that there is a lack of global technomoral leadership in the status quo, hindering any potential fruition from its cultivation or exercise.
                    Example of Virtue
                    The film Monsters University, is a film showcasing the journey of an unconventional team challenging the status quo. In the film, Mike is an ambitious young monster who dreams of becoming a top scarer. However, he faces a significant challenge: he lacks the natural scare abilities possessed by his peers. Despite this setback, Mike doesn‚Äôt give up. The protagonist Mike Wazowski demonstrates magnanimity through his actions leading his team through ‚ÄúScare Games,‚Äù a series of competitions between students to compare the scare skills of each team. Rather than fixating solely on winning the Scare Games (a series of competitions among students), Mike focuses on intangible qualities. He doesn‚Äôt engage in petty rivalries or ego-involved contests. His goal isn‚Äôt just personal glory; he wants to prove that hard work, determination, and teamwork matter more than innate talent. To strengthen the bond between his teammates, Mike brings his team on a field trip to a nearby Monsters Inc facility. As one of the top scaring companies in this fictional world, his teammates have looked up to these professional scarers in hopes of one day joining the industry alongside them. At the facility, Mike inspires his team by asking them to see what professional scarers have in common. He continues by adding that professional scarers do not have anything in common. In fact, each monster in a professional scaring role is hired because of their unique attributes and qualities rather than a single common characteristic that might qualify them as ‚Äúscary.‚Äù Initially a team of misfits, Mike embodies magnanimity to to support his teammates even when they doubt themselves. His leadership isn‚Äôt about dominating others; it‚Äôs about fostering a sense of community and shared purpose. Just like Vallor‚Äôs vision of technomoral leaders, Mike exemplifies virtues that benefit the greater community.

                    <h2>Wisdom</h2>
                    
                    <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p>
                    Wisdom, is a collection of all above virtues. It is an integrated moral expertise of an exemplary person who reliably practices moral habits and ‚Äú[uses] those habits to cultivate and integrate the virtues essential to flourishing in their given moral world‚Äù (p. 154). Technomoral wisdom differs from all other virtues as it is a general condition and outcome of well-cultivated and practiced moral expertise. To obtain this condition demands both an individual and collective expression of each of the other virtues of character for the purpose of living well with new technology (pp.154-155).

                    A pre-requisite for wisdom is the culmination of all other virtues. Having centuries of experience in practicing martial arts and training others, this character‚Äôs deep understanding of life is shared in his pieces advice to his students. In Kung Fu Panda: In the Valley of Peace, the protagonist, Po, is guided by an all-wise master, Master Oogway. The film begins with Oogway choosing Po as the next ‚ÄúDragon Warrrior,‚Äù the next master-in-line to take on new students and pass on his wisdom. His famous quote‚Äî‚ÄúYesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, but today is a gift‚Äù‚Äîencourages Po to put his attention on events in the present. Po, initially seen as a clumsy panda, evolves into a hero. Oogway‚Äôs wisdom lies in nurturing potential and allowing growth to unfold. Just as Oogway shares his wisdom with Po and others, technomoral wisdom requires a shared commitment to ethical living in the digital age.
