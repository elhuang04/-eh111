                    Given that there are over 180 student organizations present and active on the Wellesley College
                    campus, extracurricular events on-campus are clearly an important aspect of student life. Even
                    outside of Wellesley, participation in extracurriculars such as sports and fitness, show a
                    demonstrated increase in student leadership development, academic performance, general well-being
                    (physical, mental, emotional), and a strengthened sense of social belonging (Soria, Boettcher, &
                    Hallahan, 2022)<sup>1</sup>. While these benefits are clear, there is a lack of research and
                    understanding in higher education on “the effect on students of their attendance at on-campus
                    lectures, performances, panels, and other cultural events.”<sup>2</sup> To observe this effect
                    further, a study at Juniata College used qualitative research methods, collecting 793 reflection
                    papers written by 206 students describing their experiences and benefits from attending on-campus
                    events. Of these results, 361 of the reflections described a positive impact, in which the students
                    felt motivated to attend a similar event in the future or gained a deeper understanding of something
                    new.

                    We aim to achieve a comprehensive understanding of how Wellesley College students learn about and
                    decide to attend on-campus events. By identifying the most effective communication channels and
                    understanding the motivations behind student attendance, we can propose guidelines to navigate these
                    decentralized streams of event visibility and ensure equitable access to information accessible to
                    all students. Our project is an investigative inquiry on the issue of decentralized/ fragmented
                    technological communication. By providing a clear understanding of the current communication
                    landscape and proposing targeted solutions, we can significantly transform the methods by which
                    on-campus event organizers make their events visible to students in the community. For organizers,
                    this means the ability to effectively reach a larger audience and maximize attendance, ensuring
                    their efforts and hours of preparation are met with engagement. For attendees, it means having
                    easier access to and knowledge of events, particularly those that align with their interests. By
                    creating a public resource to bridge the gap between organizers and attendees, we can ensure that
                    the incredible opportunities and experiences offered on campus are accessible to a broader
                    community, bolstering individual feelings of togetherness and belonging for students and event
                    organizers (more specifically, student organizations) alike. As prior research demonstrates an
                    overall positive impact on student lives with greater event attendance, a potential solution, in
                    turn, has the potential to enhance the overall college experience for the Wellesley community,
                    solving not only immediate communication challenges but also contributing to the broader discourse
                    on the ethical and effective use of technology in higher education/ campus communities.

                <p class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">
                    A similar study conducted by the University of Tampa on motivations for students in their College of
                    Business to attend on-campus events looked at the motivations behind students attending these
                    events. The study found that “[s]ocial group status has been shown to drive a student’s motivation
                    for attending out of school activities or after-school activities.” To understand how these
                    motivations are nuanced for different kinds of on-campus events, the study “grouped extracurriculars
                    into five groups: prosocial activities, sports teams, performing arts, school involvement, and
                    academic clubs.” The study then looked into how attendance at these events impacted other aspects of
                    their college experience including “college plans, GPA, alcohol usage, drug usage, and class
                    attendance.” Results of the study indicated that in order to encourage greater participation of
                    on-campus events, the most effective strategy to incentivize students was to offer extra credit upon
                    attendance.<sup>3</sup> Given that social factors and a reward system might be good motivators for
                    students to attend these events, another aspect of on-campus events we want to understand is how
                    students learn about them in the first place.
                </p>
                <p class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">
                    Given the positive impacts of on-campus event attendance, which is factored into student motivations
                    to attend, we now ask the question: how do students learn about on-campus events in the first place?
                    From personal observation, this problem space seems immensely fragmented across various
                    communication channels: social media (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, etc.), E-mail mailing lists,
                    physical spam, group messaging platforms (iMessage, WhatsApp, GroupMe, etc.), and more. It becomes
                    clear that technology has become increasingly important to communicate information, and potentially
                    an increasingly relied-upon medium for promoting engagement in on-campus events. Our project seeks
                    to observe the following research questions throughout this project:

                    As reinstated from readings from Vallor, a core theme of our class is developing strategies to aid
                    living well with technology: “As important as they are, the engineers of the 21st century who
                    fashion code for machines are not as critical to the human mission as those who must fashion, test,
                    and disseminate technomoral code for humans - new habits and practices for living well with emerging
                    technologies. (pp 253)” The communication and discovery of on-campus events is an area of social
                    development in the Wellesley community that has become increasingly reliant on technology. To
                    navigate the various mediums in which this process has involved, we must first understand how
                    current technology shapes students’ experiences in finding on-campus events. As our findings may
                    reveal a gap in non-digital resources or pain points unaddressed by digital means, our project hopes
                    to provide a public resource to share guidelines for the Wellesley community that may assist student
                    organizations in reaching their goals with on-campus event participation.

                <h1 class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">Data Collection</h1>
                <p class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">
                    To gain a holistic understanding of on-campus event communications, we used five methods and sources
                    to gather data. First, we used a questionnaire survey sent to the largest reachable participant
                    group via Google Group email groups, amassing over 1500 distinct student accounts collectively. Our
                    survey asked questions relating to current and preferred methods for event communication, in
                    addition to motivations behind event attendance. While our survey provided us with a sample of
                    qualitative and quantitative data to form initial hypotheses about general student and event
                    organizer behavior, we then used these results to conduct a more in-depth qualitative analysis
                    throughout our focus group study (“Town Hall Meeting”) held on December 5th from 4:30 pm – 6 pm in
                    Sci L039, which was open to the entire Wellesley community. From these results, we made preliminary
                    observations on the influences of various criteria furthering student community engagement and
                    obtaining higher visibility with event communications. To support these hypotheses, we used findings
                    from 3 forms of secondary data results: a literature review from similar on-campus studies relating
                    to publicity and community engagement, commonalities between student preferences and actual event
                    actions recorded in 25Live – the event reservation system used campus-wide, and historical
                    comparisons from archival collections dating from the 1970s to early 2000s.
                </p>
                <p class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">
                    These data collection methods allowed us to engage with our three primary stakeholder groups: 1)
                    general on-campus event attendees (mostly the general student body), 2) event organizers (not
                    limited to student organization leaders), and 3) college administrators who assist with campus-wide
                    scheduling and venue reservations. Our exploration was shaped by the target stakeholder group by
                    which each data collection method was the most accessible. As the survey method was a communication
                    stream made in direct contact with students, it effectively engaged the general event attendee
                    demographic by providing an accessible way to share preferences and motivations, giving a voice to a
                    broad spectrum of attendees. Our focus group was created with event organizers and event attendee
                    participants in mind, fostering dialogue between the two stakeholder groups to explore challenges
                    and opportunities collaboratively. Lastly, our secondary data sources, which we collected with the
                    assistance of the admin stakeholder group, such as 25Live and archival records, provided context for
                    administrator decision-making and allowed us to identify trends and gaps in historical and current
                    practices. The diversity of our data sources allowed us to cross-validate our findings, reinforcing
                    conclusions where they overlapped and highlighting stakeholder-specific nuances where they differed.
                    Ultimately, the synthesis of these results underscored the necessity for a centralized event
                    communication system supported by high-quality data that addressed the needs of all stakeholders.

                    <p class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">
                        To start, we created a survey to poll the general student body and shared it across campus. We
                        ended up getting 69 responses which were distributed as: 4 Faculty/Staff members and 65 Students
                        including: 9 Eboard Members, 3 Student Workers for a Department, and 5 students who were both.
                        The questions in the survey asked about how people were finding out about events and how they
                        preferred to find out about events. Additionally, we asked the students who published events,
                        what they usually advertised with and what they found were effective. We also collected a lot of
                        personal responses and anecdotes that helped us understand how people felt about events on
                        campus.

                        In order to collect data for our research and to test our hypothesis, we held a Town Hall, focus
                        group study involving two stakeholder groups, to hear what event attendees and organizers
                        thought about how events are held and publicized on campus. We held the event primarily for
                        students because we wanted to hear how they heard about events and if they had any improvements
                        in mind from the consumer end. In holding this Town Hall, we also gathered ‘meta’ research as we
                        ourselves had to hold an event and figure out how best to publicize it. We had to think through
                        every logistic of hosting a Wellesley event including how to ensure attendance and which
                        times/locations work best.

                        We ‘pubbed’ the event in multiple mediums, including physical SPAM, word of mouth, emailed SPAM
                        to multiple groups, and individually sending out invites in personal group chats. In order to
                        honor the Wellesley tradition of SPAMing, we created flyers inspired by clubs from the past. We
                        made SPAM based off of the class of 1956 play and a Felding Medeival Society’s 2001 poster.
                        (link below in website) In order to ensure attendance, we promised food to the attendees and
                        served Thai food for dinner. We held the event on a Thursday evening at 4:30 in the science
                        center so that people could come after class and not be held up too late.

                        We began our town hall with an overview of our project. We then broke our attendees into groups
                        based on if they had ever hosted/planned an on campus event or if they had only ever attended.
                        These groups then had four minute discussions for each question and then reported back to the
                        larger group where we as a group discussed and responded to answers. After this process was
                        repeated for five questions, our final question was to be answered on a google doc individually
                        so we could have more in depth answers to the question. After the question process concluded, we
                        presented the data we collected from our surveys to the group. We then had an open mic where the
                        group could discuss whatever we didn’t get to.

                        An additional method of data collection we used for this project was 25Live, the primary tool
                        used for on-campus event/ venue reservations. In meeting with individuals from our identified
                        administrator stakeholder group; specifically, a member of the Office of Student Involvement,
                        the college department which “helps students start and run new orgs as well as plan off-campus
                        trips and on-campus concerts. And they make sure our hallowed traditions—like Lake Day and
                        Hooprolling—continue from year to year.”<sup>4</sup> and a member of the Events and Scheduling
                        Office, which guides all eligible campus event organizers through their event scheduling and
                        planning needs and manages the 25Live event reservation system, we designed and ran queries for
                        all student events from 2018–2024 and a separate grouping of queries for all student events
                        2013–2024 for all student events with expected headcount with over 50 attendees. As an event
                        reservation system<sup>5</sup>, a key limitation to the service is the inability to know live,
                        actual data such as the number of people who actually attend an event and whether related events
                        might have been double-booked (different organizations making several distinct reservations for
                        the same event purpose). In conversation with this stakeholder group, we learned that while the
                        software had been introduced to the community by 2013, there were no official enforcements that
                        required booking via 25Live until 2018. Hence, we were directed towards analyzing data only from
                        2018 and beyond as it was deemed of higher quality and with less inconsistencies in its data. A
                        summary of the system’s all time data (2013 and beyond) was shared with us to give a first
                        glimpse into this data (see Table 1).

                        Regardless of the fields used for any particular data pull, each data pull retrieved from 25Live
                        shared the following fields in its data: Event Name, Type, Status, Reference #, Organization,

                        data source is its value to quantify historical data to understand the following trends: 1) does
                        the number of events happening across campus reduce the opportunity for larger events – in other
                        words, has an increase in event count lowered the number of events that are expected to see high
                        attendance?; and 2) does an increasing number of events with similar criteria indiciate a
                        student preference for that kind of event criteria? Thus, the data we collected primarily came
                        from the following two search queries:

                        Finally, we actually took a visit to our College’s archives and were able to look at the
                        historic significance of “spam,” the name for the popular paper fliers advertising events on
                        campus. We looked backwards through the catalogues to find pieces of “spam” for events held from
                        the 1970s to early 2000s. This afforded us a better understanding as to why this, now antiquated
                        mode, was still favored by many students, it is a fun tradition of our school.

                        Our survey gave us extensive quantitative data to analyze where we found that students have
                        really enjoyed the ease of digital communication and leaning into emails as a way of learning
                        about events. However, we did also learn that organizers mostly use Physical Spam as a means of
                        publishing. Now, granted both of these questions are multi-select given that people see, and use
                        multiple types of publishing so it is worth noting that many organizers are probably using a
                        combination of these means.
                    </p>
                    <p class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">
                        Additionally we recorded a lot of written responses in the survey where people explained their
                        many frustrations with events on campus. We heard that people were overwhelmed, felt there were
                        too many events, or too many similar events. There was overstimulation at the spam boards,
                        people were bombarded with emails and Google Calendar invites, and people who have given up,
                        only attending events if a friend directly brought them. Conversely, we also heard from
                        organizers who are battling low attendance and interest. We heard of many events generating food
                        waste, from under attendance, and disheartened organizers. Most of these comments were similar
                        to why we chose to pursue this issue in the first place and we used these responses to guide the
                        questions we asked in our Town Hall focus group.

                        Interestingly, with our own survey, we found that the best means of publishing was online, it
                        spread easily and took little effort and led to a greater number of responses than physical
                        spam. Yet we hesitate to propose an online-only solution as reliance on technology can further
                        fracture communities as we’ve found people who are not “on” Google email groups or following
                        Instagram accounts or actively checking Sidechate might not necessarily hear about an event in
                        time.

                        The survey was our first mode of data collection and we used this to inform the rest of our
                        process as we sought to understand why there were so many frustrations building up over events

                        <b><i>Question 1</i>: Do you think there are too many events happening on campus?</b>
                    </p>
                    <p class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">
                        Our attendees-only group concluded that there were too many events happening on campus, more
                        specifically, too many events that were too similar. They cited study breaks specifically as
                        events hosted in oversaturation as many orgs host them at the same time with little difference
                        in content. This leads to a lot of SPAM in people’s inboxes and plastered around campus pubbing
                        the same event, eventually yielding little attendance at every event. The Eboard/hosts event
                        concluded that there were not too many events happening on campus. They agreed that the large
                        number of events makes it difficult to attend them all but they believed that people will
                        ultimately go to the ones that align with their schedule or that they are especially excited
                        about. A quote from their group was as follows, “There are not necessarily too many events.
                        People are busy, so you just have to find a time where you can go to an event, and sometimes
                        these events are really similar.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">
                        There is a clear disparity in what the intended audience for events feels versus what the
                        organizers of the events feel. The Eboard/hosts felt strongly that a diverse selection of events
                        hosted by many different people caters to a diverse community with varied interests. The
                        attendees, however, stated that many events don’t draw their attention and they are rarely
                        motivated to go to events. A proposed solution for those who host events to boost attendance and
                        to better meet the needs of the community would be to collaborate with other organizations when
                        hosting events. Not only does this bring distinct communities in contact with each other but
                        also cuts down on the number of similar events happening at once so that more people can attend.

                        Our Eboard/hosts and attendees only groups both prefer events after 4:30pm on weekdays. They
                        usually hold eboard or general members meetings for clubs on these times since people are
                        usually free after class and have a free block before dinner. For events, this group and the
                        attendees only group reported that food at an event dramatically increases the likelihood of
                        their attendance. If dinner is served at an event around mealtime, students reported feeling
                        less stressed about fitting that event into their schedule because they would have had to eat
                        anyway and are now able to attend an event and eat at the same time without drastically
                        impacting their academic/personal calendars. The participants also stated that they would only
                        go to weekend events if they were large events like culture shows because their weekends are
                        otherwise usually busy.

                    <p class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">
                        Proposed solutions for those who host events would be ensuring that their events are after 4:30
                        and organizers could send out forms asking when best works for general members before they set a
                        date. A potential conflict that could arise if all events are hosted after 4:30 on weekdays
                        would be too many events happening at once. Organizers could remedy this by collaborating with
                        other organizations.

                        <b><i>Question 4</i>: Preferred medium to hear about events?</b>
                    </p>
                    <p class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">
                        Both the attendees and Eboard/hosts groups agreed as a whole that digital advertising is more
                        effective in publicizing events as it is more permanent than a physical flyer. While one might
                        only see a flyer when they are in the dining hall or in their dorm, an email is present every
                        time they open their inbox. Our attendees also reported that they appreciate when emails include
                        a link that automatically populates an organization’s event onto their google calendar so they
                        don’t have to manually add anything. This makes it easier to remember when events are and people
                        are often reminded and more inclined to go to an event when it is already in their calendar.
                        Digital spam is also preferred to physical spam because people rarely intentionally internalize
                        spam boards on campus and often forget about events published there. Both groups, however, did
                        highlight the merits of physical spam as it does serve a purpose and can be effective if placed
                        in the right areas. The Eboard/hosts group reported that they use Sidechat often as a last
                        minute boost before an event is beginning to remind people of the event.

                    <p class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">
                        A proposed solution to this would be ensuring that when pubbing an event, organizers are
                        utilizing all mediums of advertising. Only using physical spam and instagram posts is not as
                        effective as using them as well as emails to reach a wider audience and remind people that an
                        event is happening.

                    <p class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">
                        Both the attendees and Eboard/hosts group concluded that physical spam is most effective in
                        elevators since people are in a closed setting and are forced to look at it. They also
                        highlighted lulu and dorm community boards as effective places because there is a lot of foot
                        traffic in those areas. All attendees agreed that sending out digital versions of physical spams
                        through email is really effective as people are still able to appreciate the flyers but also
                        save the event digitally.

                        The data for this question was recorded through written responses as instead of discussing with
                        their peers before responding, all attendees recorded their individual responses. Many responses
                        advocated more organization specific google calendars as they are a constant reminder of what is
                        coming up, allowing people to plan ahead and accommodate if they are especially interested in an
                        event. Email chains with a link to add event to one’s google calendar was also advocated for.
                        The main recommendation from our attendees was a community calendar with all of the events
                        happening on campus so that people can go there to see all events, not just the ones they are on
                        email lists for.

                        A community wide calendar is in the works by LTS and will hopefully solve this issue and better

                        strongly encouraged to boost attendance for campus events.

                        To investigate our first area of inquiry, we created heatmaps to illustrate the density of
                        events hosted per month. Overall, our data demonstrated that there has been a significant
                        increase in events happening each calendar year, especially after the Covid-19 pandemic
                        disrupted campus life. We observe several trends involving the number of events held regarding
                        the time period on a macroscopic scale. April, across all academic years, has always held the
                        highest number of events with exception to the pandemic year). In our heatmap, we use darker
                        blocks to represent months of the academic year which held a greater magnitude of events. From
                        year to year, we can see that each academic year is generally filled with a darker shade than
                        the previous year. In our meeting with this stakeholder group, we learned that the most recent
                        academic year (2023–2024) has seen the highest number of event reservations on this campus,
                        reflected by the darkest square on the heatmap in April 2024, which held 313 general events, and
                        168 student-specific (excluding meetings, practices, rehearsals), and 64 largely attended events
                        in that month alone, accounting for 1800 events overall (29.14% of all-time data).

                        In meeting with our stakeholders, we learned that planning for large events has become
                        increasingly difficult with the continuous population of new student organizations and competing
                        event timelines. Our stakeholders mentioned several instances of needing to account for
                        “noise-bleed,” the possibility that a largely attended event with loud noise might interfere
                        with the environment of another largely attended event. Consequently, when helping student
                        organization leaders plan and manage their event, they would need to ensure that the requested
                        time and date wouldn’t conflict with another large event opportunity and that the event
                        experience would be seamless for the organizations that host them. When competing timelines were
                        unable to be resolved, our stakeholders mentioned that they would host the events preferably at
                        two ends of the campus (West side/ East side) to eliminate noise bleed and adjust timelines to
                        extend or shorten to accommodate for simultaneous activities. Additionally, at events that
                        expected hundreds of students in attendance that were in conflict with another high attendance
                        event, our admin stakeholders recognized that student organizations were dissatisfied with the
                        turnout of their event, hoping to have received more attendance if they had occurred on a
                        separate occasion to the other. To demonstrate this problem further, we created several
                        visualizations to represent the measure of events happening on various time scales.
                    </p>
                    <p class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">
                        In Figure 4.2.4, the visualization plots all days which had at least one event on a particular
                        date. The significant spikes in the graph indicate the specific days which had a large number of
                        events happening on that day. To abstract our findings, we created a secondary visualization for
                        just the top 5 days which had the highest number of events held on them (see Figure 4.2.5). In
                        the leftmost bar, indicating the number of events held on January 29th, 2023, we observe 30
                        events on that day alone. A summary of our data and a visualization (see Table 4.2.6 and Figure
                        4.2.7) of the distribution of events shared on the same date demonstrates a clear pattern: while
                        there are occasional spikes with a significant number of events on a single day, the overall
                        distribution reveals that event counts are consistently high, further supporting the presence of
                        competing timelines. Additionally, when charting the relationship between large events (events
                        expecting significant attendance) and smaller events (see Figure 4.2.8), we see a steady
                        increase in the number of smaller events while the count of large events on campus consistently
                        remains at around 200. The relative stability in the overall number of large events amidst the
                        proliferation in hosting smaller events could indicate potential strain or competition for
                        attendance and resources. These findings underscore that while the campus continues to host a
                        growing volume of events, the concentration of several activities on the same dates could be a
                        source of fragmented engagement, hindering opportunities for larger events to reach their full
                        potential. We believe that this oversaturation of events on campus has potentially become
                        detrimental to the quality of events and the attendance of people at each event.

                        From the following figures, Figure 4.2.9 and Figure 4.2.10, we observe that a significant
                        majority of events occur after 4pm, with the most popular starting time for events being 7:00pm,
                        closely followed by 6:00pm. This data, supported by our primary sources of data collection,
                        strongly aligns with student preference criteria as reflected in event reservations. Through our
                        Town Hall discussions and survey responses, it was clear that both event attendees and
                        organizers favor hosting and attending events between 4:00pm and 7:30pm, with a notable
                        preference for events that include food around meal times, such as 5:00pm or 6:00pm. The data
                        collected via 25Live clearly corroborates these preferences, showing a majority of events
                        happening within this preferred time frame, thus validating our understanding of student
                        behavior and preferences.

                        In essence, our analysis indicates that the increasing number of events across campus can indeed
                        reduce the opportunity for events to achieve high attendance counts. This phenomenon is linked
                        to the strain on resources and audience engagement caused by the increase of smaller events,
                        which compete for the same time slots, resources, and attendees. When multiple events are
                        scheduled concurrently, it fragments the potential audience, making it challenging for any
                        single event to draw a large crowd. Additionally, the consistent scheduling preferences observed
                        in our data strongly align with student behaviors. Students and event organizers show a clear
                        preference for events scheduled between late afternoon and early evening, particularly around
                        meal times. Our data in the increasing number of events scheduled during these peak times
                        indicates a strong student preference for this event timing. Consequently, aligning event
                        planning with these preferences can enhance overall campus engagement and ensure that both large
                        and small events are successful without detracting from each other. These findings underscore
                        the importance of strategic event management to balance the quantity and quality of campus
                        events.

                        In the spam we were able to find from the Archives collection, there are several key
                        observations we can make about the historical trends in spam over the past couple of decades. A
                        summary of our key observations on the characterization of spam can be found below (see Table
                        4.4.1). Overall, we can generalize that not only has the dissemination of spam become more
                        digitized over the years, but the creation of spam has become increasingly intertwined with
                        digital technology as well. In the earliest dated artifacts of spam we were able to find from
                        1978, we can observe that the purpose of spam is purely informational. The overall designs of
                        the spam are clear, concise, and minimal, and integrate typewritten text with handwritten text.
                        In contrast, the most recent piece of spam found from our archival search circa 2007, cites
                        Google as the source for its images, and the design of the spam is clearly formatted through a
                        digital software with digital typeface packages such as Century Gothic and Times New Roman. Now,
                        the creation of our spam has further evolved. The majority of spam across campus can appear
                        almost identical as they simply modify event-specific information on Canva templates, a digital
                        software, specially made to lower the learning curve for everyday graphic designs. To understand
                        why these design progressions may have occurred and how they have shaped the spam we have today,
                        we further examine the differences throughout each decade of Wellesley’s spam and publicizing
                        strategies.

                        We found, in publishing and advertising our own survey that online was the best way to go, it
                        was faster and more effective. For reference, for our physical spam, we printed out and put up
                        30 pieces. They took about ~30 minutes to design and then each group project member had to walk
                        to different residence halls, academic buildings, and dining halls to post the flyers. All this
                        work yielded 7 responses, 7, that’s it. It was time intensive and with very little efficacy.
                    </p>
                    <p class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">
                        However, that is not to say that it wasn’t worth it to make the physical spam. In the written
                        responses of the survey, many people responded that they really enjoy physical spam. People
                        cited visual appeal, historic connection, and an appreciation for the time and effort put into
                        it as reasons they enjoyed the merits of this tradition. People have said they enjoy
                        periodically checking the spam boards and seeing all the events that are happening at the
                        College. Additionally, we, as the researchers, quite enjoyed making the spam, it was fun and
                        creative and a good break from the tedium of homework.
                    </p>
                    <p class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">
                        In our visit to the archives, we got to see a lot of the historic spam from Wellesley Clubs such
                        as the Felding Society, Philosophy Club, and the Film Society, dating back as far as the 1970s.
                        We also got to look at hand-made booklets from the College’s Float Day, Tree Day, and Crew
                        events in the 1960s. Seeing the meticulous care put into the drawings, handwriting, and creative
                        messaging of these posters helped us understand why spam remains a cherished form of campus
                        communication: it is a relic and tradition of the past. We enjoyed all the care that was put
                        into the drawings, handwriting, and fun quips used to advertise the events. It was a great trip
                        to the past and led us to have a greater appreciation for the physical posters that decorate our
                        campus, even if we originally found it archaic.
                    </p>
                    <p class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">
                        From the Town Hall, we heard great insights about student perceptions on event saturation,
                        timing, and communication preferences. Ultimately, our meeting confirmed that physical spam,
                        though time attentive and limited in reach, remains well liked by students, particularly when
                        placed in high-traffic locations. The visual appeals make it stand out, offering a break from
                        the digital clutter. Meanwhile, digital communication tools like GCal and email emerged as
                        essential for ensuring efficiency and broader reach in event promotion. Moving forward, our
                        findings suggest that event organizers can better engage students by blending their preferences.
                        This includes prioritizing strategic spam placement, utilizing email lists and department
                        newsletters, offering clear and attractive messaging, and incorporating interesting food options
                        for events. This can effectively combine both physical and digital methods in a way that ensures
                        a broader reach while still respecting students’ time and preferences.

                    <h1 class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">Conclusion</h1>
                    <p class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">
                        Our data was used to generate the main conclusions in our main deliverable, the pamphlet guide
                        to publishing spam + events on campus. We wove together data from all our sources to create
                        actionable steps towards improving these events, and their turn out, that help grow our
                        community on campus. Our research group hypothesized that the overwhelming increase of event
                        publicity (“spam”) across all relevant communication platforms may be an underlying cause for
                        dwindling attendance. In an effort to understand the nuances of how to ensure attendance at
                        events, we collected data from multiple sources including 25Live data, surveys from the general
                        public, a record on the evolution of pubbing from Wellesley’s archives, and qualitative data
                        from an in-person town hall. Through our analysis, we identified (stakeholder-specific)
                        strategies that would drastically increase event attendance and likely boost community morale on
                        campus.
                    </p>
                    <p class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">
                        Data from all sources reinforced each other and confirmed a significant increase in events on
                        campus, yielding lower attendance rates per event as students are overwhelmed by choice. A main
                        solution to this problem would be encouraging collaboration between organizations in events. The
                        need for distinctive cultural and identity-affirming events are clear, however, collaboration
                        outside of these larger events is crucial in creating a more interwoven community. As more
                        organizations are created each year—many variations on organizations that already exist—the
                        Wellesley community becomes more fractured and individualistic. This problem is worsened when
                        the calendar begins to fill up and orgs must compete with each other for attendance when they
                        could instead collaborate and host events that comingle groups that would ordinarily not be in
                        contact with each other. With multiple hosts, these organizations will find it easier to
                        publicize their events and divide labor efficiently.

                        In her introduction of Envisioning the Good Life in the 21st Century and Beyond, Shannon Vallor
                        claims, “A global information society enabled by a massive electronic communications network of
                        unprecedented bandwidth and computing power has indeed emerged; but far from enabling a ‘new
                        world order’ of a utopian or dystopian sort, the information age heralds an increasingly
                        disordered geopolitics and widening fractures in the public commons.” (Vallor, 5).
                        Technology—through email chains you must be enrolled in and Instagram accounts you must
                        follow—boxes ourselves into groups at Wellesley. Once we are neatly tucked away, it becomes easy
                        to not venture out. Each digital pubbing channel is highly specific to the group in mind, making
                        it hard for non group members to hear about events they might be interested in. The aims of this
                        class include how one may live well in harmony with technology, and not to let technology shape
                        the way we live. If we continue to hold community events in isolated forums, the possibility of
                        a fractured Wellesley community becomes more real with cracks deepening by isolation perpetrated
                        by organization-specific technologies. To bridge these potential gaps and bring together our
                        community as well as living a technologically good life that is in tandem with technology, we
                        must work together to host events and bring new people and perspectives into the conversation.
