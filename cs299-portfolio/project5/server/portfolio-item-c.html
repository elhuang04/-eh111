                <p class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">
                    Given that there are over 180 student organizations present and active on the Wellesley College
                    campus, extracurricular events on-campus are clearly an important aspect of student life. Even
                    outside of Wellesley, participation in extracurriculars such as sports and fitness, show a
                    demonstrated increase in student leadership development, academic performance, general well-being
                    (physical, mental, emotional), and a strengthened sense of social belonging (Soria, Boettcher, &
                    Hallahan, 2022). While these benefits are clear, there is a lack of research and understanding in
                    higher education on “the effect on students of their attendance at on-campus lectures, performances,
                    panels, and other cultural events.” To observe this effect further, a study at Juniata College used
                    qualitative research methods, collecting 793 reflection papers written by 206 students describing
                    their experiences and benefits from attending on-campus events. Of these results, 361 of the
                    reflections described a positive impact, in which the students felt motivated to attend a similar
                    event in the future or gained a deeper understanding of something new.
                </p>
                <p class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">
                    We aim to achieve a comprehensive understanding of how Wellesley College students learn about and
                    decide to attend on-campus events. By identifying the most effective communication channels and
                    understanding the motivations behind student attendance, we can propose guidelines to navigate these
                    decentralized streams of event visibility and ensure equitable access to information accessible to
                    all students. Our project is an investigative inquiry on the issue of decentralized/ fragmented
                    technological communication. By providing a clear understanding of the current communication
                    landscape and proposing targeted solutions, we can significantly transform the methods by which
                    on-campus event organizers make their events visible to students in the community. For organizers,
                    this means the ability to effectively reach a larger audience and maximize attendance, ensuring
                    their efforts and hours of preparation are met with engagement. For attendees, it means having
                    easier access to and knowledge of events, particularly those that align with their interests. By
                    creating a public resource to bridge the gap between organizers and attendees, we can ensure that
                    the incredible opportunities and experiences offered on campus are accessible to a broader
                    community, bolstering individual feelings of togetherness and belonging for students and event
                    organizers (more specifically, student organizations) alike. As prior research demonstrates an
                    overall positive impact on student lives with greater event attendance, a potential solution, in
                    turn, has the potential to enhance the overall college experience for the Wellesley community,
                    solving not only immediate communication challenges but also contributing to the broader discourse
                    on the ethical and effective use of technology in higher education/ campus communities.

                <p class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">
                    A similar study conducted by the University of Tampa on motivations for students in their College of
                    Business to attend on-campus events looked at the motivations behind students attending these
                    events. The study found that “[s]ocial group status has been shown to drive a student’s motivation
                    for attending out of school activities or after-school activities.” To understand how these
                    motivations are nuanced for different kinds of on-campus events, the study “grouped extracurriculars
                    into five groups: prosocial activities, sports teams, performing arts, school involvement, and
                    academic clubs.” The study then looked into how attendance at these events impacted other aspects of
                    their college experience including “college plans, GPA, alcohol usage, drug usage, and class
                    attendance.” Results of the study indicated that in order to encourage greater participation of
                    on-campus events, the most effective strategy to incentivize students was to offer extra credit upon
                    attendance. Given that social factors and a reward system might be good motivators for students to
                    attend these events, another aspect of on-campus events we want to understand is how students learn
                    about them in the first place.
                </p>
                <p class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">
                    Given the positive impacts of on-campus event attendance, which is factored into student motivations
                    to attend, we now ask the question: how do students learn about on-campus events in the first place?
                    From personal observation, this problem space seems immensely fragmented across various
                    communication channels: social media (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, etc.), E-mail mailing lists,
                    physical spam, group messaging platforms (iMessage, WhatsApp, GroupMe, etc.), and more. It becomes
                    clear that technology has become increasingly important to communicate information, and potentially
                    an increasingly relied-upon medium for promoting engagement in on-campus events. Our project seeks
                    to observe the following research questions throughout this project:

                <p class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">
                    As reinstated from readings from Vallor, a core theme of our class is developing strategies to aid
                    living well with technology: “As important as they are, the engineers of the 21st century who
                    fashion code for machines are not as critical to the human mission as those who must fashion, test,
                    and disseminate technomoral code for humans - new habits and practices for living well with emerging
                    technologies. (pp 253)” The communication and discovery of on-campus events is an area of social
                    development in the Wellesley community that has become increasingly reliant on technology. To
                    navigate the various mediums in which this process has involved, we must first understand how
                    current technology shapes students’ experiences in finding on-campus events. As our findings may
                    reveal a gap in non-digital resources or pain points unaddressed by digital means, our project hopes
                    to provide a public resource to share guidelines for the Wellesley community that may assist student
                    organizations in reaching their goals with on-campus event participation.

            <section id="collect">
                <h1 class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">Data Collection</h1>
                <p class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">
                    To gain a holistic understanding of on-campus event communications, we used five methods and sources
                    to gather data. First, we used a questionnaire survey sent to the largest reachable participant
                    group via Google Group email groups, amassing over 1500 distinct student accounts collectively. Our
                    survey asked questions relating to current and preferred methods for event communication, in
                    addition to motivations behind event attendance. While our survey provided us with a sample of
                    qualitative and quantitative data to form initial hypotheses about general student and event
                    organizer behavior, we then used these results to conduct a more in-depth qualitative analysis
                    throughout our focus group study (“Town Hall Meeting”) held on December 5th from 4:30 pm – 6 pm in
                    Sci L039, which was open to the entire Wellesley community. From these results, we made preliminary
                    observations on the influences of various criteria furthering student community engagement and
                    obtaining higher visibility with event communications. To support these hypotheses, we used findings
                    from 3 forms of secondary data results: a literature review from similar on-campus studies relating
                    to publicity and community engagement, commonalities between student preferences and actual event
                    actions recorded in 25Live – the event reservation system used campus-wide, and historical
                    comparisons from archival collections dating from the 1970s to early 2000s.
                </p>
                <p class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">
                    These data collection methods allowed us to engage with our three primary stakeholder groups: 1)
                    general on-campus event attendees (mostly the general student body), 2) event organizers (not
                    limited to student organization leaders), and 3) college administrators who assist with campus-wide
                    scheduling and venue reservations. Our exploration was shaped by the target stakeholder group by
                    which each data collection method was the most accessible. As the survey method was a communication
                    stream made in direct contact with students, it effectively engaged the general event attendee
                    demographic by providing an accessible way to share preferences and motivations, giving a voice to a
                    broad spectrum of attendees. Our focus group was created with event organizers and event attendee
                    participants in mind, fostering dialogue between the two stakeholder groups to explore challenges
                    and opportunities collaboratively. Lastly, our secondary data sources, which we collected with the
                    assistance of the admin stakeholder group, such as 25Live and archival records, provided context for
                    administrator decision-making and allowed us to identify trends and gaps in historical and current
                    practices. The diversity of our data sources allowed us to cross-validate our findings, reinforcing
                    conclusions where they overlapped and highlighting stakeholder-specific nuances where they differed.
                    Ultimately, the synthesis of these results underscored the necessity for a centralized event
                    communication system supported by high-quality data that addressed the needs of all stakeholders.

                <h4 class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">Survey</h4>
                <p class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">
                    To start, we created a survey to poll the general student body and shared it across campus. We ended
                    up getting 69 responses which were distributed as: 4 Faculty/Staff members and 65 Students
                    including: 9 Eboard Members, 3 Student Workers for a Department, and 5 students who were both. The
                    questions in the survey asked about how people were finding out about events and how they preferred
                    to find out about events. Additionally, we asked the students who published events, what they
                    usually advertised with and what they found were effective. We also collected a lot of personal
                    responses and anecdotes that helped us understand how people felt about events on campus.

                <h4 class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">Townhall</h4>
                <p class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">
                    In order to collect data for our research and to test our hypothesis, we held a townhall to hear
                    what students thought about how events are held and publicized on campus. We held the event for
                    students because we wanted to hear how they heard about events and if they had any improvements in
                    mind from the consumer end. In holding this townhall, we also gathered ‘meta’ research as we
                    ourselves had to hold an event and figure out how best to publicize it. We had to think through
                    every logistic of hosting a Wellesley event including how to ensure attendance and which
                    times/locations work best.
                </p>
                <p class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">
                    We ‘pubbed’ the event in multiple mediums, including physical SPAM, word of mouth, emailed SPAM to
                    multiple groups, and individually sending out invites in personal group chats. In order to honor the
                    Wellesley tradition of SPAMing, we created flyers inspired by clubs from the past. We made SPAM
                    based off of the class of 1956 play and a Felding Medeival Society’s 2001 poster. (link below in
                    website) In order to ensure attendance, we promised food to the attendees and served Thai food for
                    dinner. We held the event on a Thursday evening at 4:30 in the science center so that people could
                    come after class and not be held up too late.
                </p>
                <p class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">
                    We began our town hall with an overview of our project. We then broke our attendees into groups
                    based on if they had ever hosted/planned an on campus event or if they had only ever attended. These
                    groups then had four minute discussions for each question and then reported back to the larger group
                    where we as a group discussed and responded to answers. After this process was repeated for five
                    questions, our final question was to be answered on a google doc individually so we could have more
                    in depth answers to the question. After the question process concluded, we presented the data we
                    collected from our surveys to the group. We then had an open mic where the group could discuss
                    whatever we didn’t get to.
