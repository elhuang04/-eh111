        <h4 class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">Consent and Transparency</h4>
        <p class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">
          We include clear and detailed consent language in both our survey form and focus group communications,
          ensuring that participants understand how their data will be collected, used, and stored. Consent language
          (referenced from Brandeis University<sup>1</sup>) is included in our survey form (upon intake) and all focus group
          communications:
        </p>
        
        <p class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">1. Survey Form [<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Kh3kMalEfUWq2lj3Ux2tECCcRhoQl2kehRZ61RxThqE/edit" target="_blank">link</a>]</p>
        <p class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">2. Town Hall (Focus Group) Consent Form [<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Gpdv3Uj0ivSltdpoYP4B-2gLqQ_uGHh68ILJHzFfta4/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">link</a>]<sup>2</sup></p>
        
        <h4 class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">Privacy and Confidentiality</h4>
        <p class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">
          All data collected from surveys and focus groups will be anonymized to protect participant identities. For
          town hall participants, a consent form will be provided outlining the study's two components: a survey (10-25
          minutes) and a town hall meeting (1 hour). The consent form will inform participants of the potential risks,
          such as data leaks and the lack of full confidentiality during the town hall, where participants will agree
          not to share or link discussions to individuals, though confidentiality within the group cannot be guaranteed.
          Participants will also be informed of the benefits, including entry into a raffle for a $25 Amazon gift card
          and free food for town hall attendees. Data will be anonymized in reports and publicly shared, while
          identifiable data will be securely retained for analysis.
        </p>

        <h4 class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">Avoiding Harm</h4>
        <p class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">
          Event planning and attendance are
          closely tied to personal and organizational priorities and student interests, and we will be mindful of this
          connection throughout our research. Any criticism or feedback shared during discussions will be handled
          carefully to ensure it does not inadvertently harm individual or organizational reputations both in our final
          deliverable and during our research process. Our feedback mechanisms will focus on systemic issues rather than
          singling out specific individuals or groups, promoting constructive and solution-oriented discussions.

          We engaged the Wellesley community and gathered data in the following 3 methods:
        </p>
        <p class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">
          <b>1.</b> Focus group study (“Town Hall Meeting”) held on December 5th from 4:30pm – 6pm in Sci L039 open to the

          We summarize the makeup of our research demographic in 3 key stakeholder groups: 1) the general student
          population, 2) event organizers (not limited to student organization leaders), and 3) college administrators
          who assist with campus-wide scheduling and venue reservations.

      <section id="sustainability">
        <h1 class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">Benefits & Sustainability</h1>
        <p class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">
          To measure the success of this project, we will track both objective and subjective metrics. Objective metrics
          will include the number of survey responses, event attendance data from organizers, and the aggregation of
          spam posting reach, which will help us assess how well events are being communicated and attended. Subjective
          metrics will include community feedback, student accessibility ratings, and overall satisfaction, providing
          insight into how well the event information is reaching and engaging students, and contributing to a greater
          sense of belonging on campus.
        </p>
        <h4 class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">Immediate Benefits</h4>
        <p class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">
          The immediate benefits of this project will directly impact both event organizers and students. By collecting
          and analyzing our survey and Townhall data, we will provide organizers with actionable insights to improve
          events promotion and outreach. Event organizers will benefit from a clearer understanding of how to better
          target their communication strategies, ensuring that more students are reached through the channels they use
          most effectively. For students, the improved communication and clearer event messaging will lead to greater
          accessibility and convenience, allowing them to better plan their schedules and attend events that interest
          them. The creation of our pamphlet will serve as a quick reference-guide that can be used immediately to
          refine current event promotion efforts.
        </p>
        <h4 class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">Long-Term Impact</h4>
        <p class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">
          To ensure long-term impact, we will create a publicly accessible resource summarizing our findings, focusing
          on which communication channels are most effective in promoting events. This will include strategies and
          guidelines that event organizers can use to strengthen visibility based on our research, particularly
          addressing why some events may be disproportionately underrepresented. We will compile these strategies into a
          publicly accessible pamphlet, to be distributed across campus (both in a physical and digital format),
          outlining actionable strategies for navigating the current ecosystem of digital tech surrounding on-campus
          events that can improve event visibility. Additionally, we will have a more formalized technical documentation
          of our research methodologies, so the work can be continued and adapted in the future. By conversing with
          student organization leads and general students alongside our development of the deliverable, we aim to create
          a sustainable framework that ensures better event engagement and attendance moving forward.
