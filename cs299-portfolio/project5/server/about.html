                <p class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">
                    Given that there are over 180 student organizations present and active on the Wellesley College
                    campus, extracurricular events on-campus are clearly an important aspect of student life. Even
                    outside of Wellesley, participation in extracurriculars such as sports and fitness, show a
                    demonstrated increase in student leadership development, academic performance, general well-being
                    (physical, mental, emotional), and a strengthened sense of social belonging (Soria, Boettcher, &
                    Hallahan, 2022). While these benefits are clear, there is a lack of research and understanding in
                    higher education on “the effect on students of their attendance at on-campus lectures, performances,
                    panels, and other cultural events.” To observe this effect further, a study at Juniata College used
                    qualitative research methods, collecting 793 reflection papers written by 206 students describing
                    their experiences and benefits from attending on-campus events. Of these results, 361 of the
                    reflections described a positive impact, in which the students felt motivated to attend a similar
                    event in the future or gained a deeper understanding of something new.

                    We aim to achieve a comprehensive understanding of how Wellesley College students learn about and
                    decide to attend on-campus events. By identifying the most effective communication channels and
                    understanding the motivations behind student attendance, we can propose guidelines to navigate these
                    decentralized streams of event visibility and ensure equitable access to information accessible to
                    all students. Our project is an investigative inquiry on the issue of decentralized/ fragmented
                    technological communication. By providing a clear understanding of the current communication
                    landscape and proposing targeted solutions, we can significantly transform the methods by which
                    on-campus event organizers make their events visible to students in the community. For organizers,
                    this means the ability to effectively reach a larger audience and maximize attendance, ensuring
                    their efforts and hours of preparation are met with engagement. For attendees, it means having
                    easier access to and knowledge of events, particularly those that align with their interests. By
                    creating a public resource to bridge the gap between organizers and attendees, we can ensure that
                    the incredible opportunities and experiences offered on campus are accessible to a broader
                    community, bolstering individual feelings of togetherness and belonging for students and event
                    organizers (more specifically, student organizations) alike. As prior research demonstrates an
                    overall positive impact on student lives with greater event attendance, a potential solution, in
                    turn, has the potential to enhance the overall college experience for the Wellesley community,
                    solving not only immediate communication challenges but also contributing to the broader discourse
                    on the ethical and effective use of technology in higher education/ campus communities.
